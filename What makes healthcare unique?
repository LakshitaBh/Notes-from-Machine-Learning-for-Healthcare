- Several algorithms for healthcare existed before but those were never utilized in hospitals. Because of lack of data, manual efforts to create data, algorithms not robust - couldn’t work in different location (because of lack of standardization)
- Now - Increase in Electronic Health Records + computing power + standadization of health records(diagnosis codes - ICD-9 or ICD-10 and laboratory codes - LOINC and National Drug Codes and Unified Medical Language System(UMLS))+ more public medical datasets (Roger Mark, MIT) + breakthroughs in Machine Learning. Now all data can be converted to one single format and ML models can be applied.
- We still have very less labeled data so semi supervised learning algorithms are important
- Why unique
    - Life and death situation
    - Small labeled data (algo can use electronic phenotyping)
    - small number of samples in some cases (eg. rare cases)
    - large amount of missing data (such as lab records present when tests done but other things like glucose level may be missing)
    - censored data
    - data is sensitive - need to remove private data; data sharing agreement takes time
    - Deploying ML model is difficult in existing hospital systems
- Some applications discussed:
    - Risk stratification - who might need to get admitted into hospital in next 30 days ?etc.
    - discoveries - such as discovering disease subtypes; drug discovery
    - diagnosis
    - precision medicine
    - showing plans to doctor when patient arrives in ICU/emergency
