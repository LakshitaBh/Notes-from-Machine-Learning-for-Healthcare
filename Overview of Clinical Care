- Earlier we only tried to feed an algo with symptoms and come to a diagnosis but the reality is that the patient would come back saying that this treatment didnt work, then again the course of treatment changes. It’s a cycle not a one time thing
- What are we trying to do?
    
    Look at the way healthcare works and figure out a way to improve it by examining its operation. There are three places we can look at to improve:
    
    - treating a person’s illness (it’s a cycle-doctor gives medicine, patient comes back with the outcome and doctor makes changes - repeat)
    - at a larger phase such as somebody being well for a while and then sick, then well for a while and sick again
    - at the healthcare system level itself
